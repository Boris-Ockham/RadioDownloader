# Favourites Tab

This tab shows you the programmes that you have marked as being your
favourites. Favourites don't automatically download new episodes like
[subscriptions](views.subscriptions.md), but they are a way to easily access
your favourite programmes without searching for them.

Select a programme from the list to get more information about it.
