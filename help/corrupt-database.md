# Corrupt Database

Radio Downloader uses a database to store your settings, lists of subscriptions
and downloads, and information about the programmes. Occasionally, this can get
damaged due to a hardware or software fault.

If Radio Downloader has sent you to this page, it unfortunately means that your
Radio Downloader database has become corrupted and needs to be repaired.

## Repairing Your Database

I have written a small utility which makes a backup of your database and then
attempts to repair it (retaining as much of your data as possible), which you
can [download
