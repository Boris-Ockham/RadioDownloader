# Installation

Simply [download](https://nerdoftheherd.com/tools/radiodld/) and run the setup
file. If you are running Windows XP you may need to install the [.NET framework
2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1639) first.
After you have accepted the license agreement and chosen 'Install', Radio
Downloader will be installed on your system and started for you.

If you have already got an old version of Radio Downloader installed, you can
follow exactly the same process. There is no need to uninstall the previous
version (or even close it first) and all of your data will remain in place.
