# Contribute to Radio Downloader

If you have found Radio Downloader useful and would like to 'give something
back', here are a few options:

## Answer people's questions

Due to the number of people using Radio Downloader (and my limited free time),
I can't give people as much help and support as I'd like. You can help out by
adding comments to the individual [help pages](index.md) to add more detail or
suggest corrections.

## Make a donation

If you are unable to donate your time, financial contributions are always
gratefully received to cover hosting and development costs. There is a PayPal
donate button at the very bottom of this (and every other) page, which goes to
me directly.

## Contribute code

I don't currently have enough time to implement all of the [requested
enhancements](https://github.com/ribbons/RadioDownloader/issues?labels=enhancement&amp;milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open)
for Radio Downloader, so I would welcome [pull
requests](https://github.com/ribbons/RadioDownloader/pulls) to implement these.

For more information about getting started with Radio Downloader development,
please see the ['Develop' section of the README
file](https://github.com/ribbons/RadioDownloader#develop).
