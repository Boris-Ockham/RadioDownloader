# Report Bugs in Radio Downloader

To report a bug or request an enhancement in Radio Downloader, you need to
[create a new issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/ribbons/RadioDownloader/issues/new).

Before you create an issue, quickly search the [existing
issues](https://github.com/ribbons/RadioDownloader/issues) to see if there is a
match for your problem or enhancement. If another issue is similar (but not
exactly the same) it is always best to create a new one as I can easily combine
the two later.

If Radio Downloader gives you the option to report an error, please send it and
then include the error report number in the issue you create. Also, remember to
give me plenty of info; the steps to reproduce a crash, a podcast feed url that
fails to work, or the full name of programmes and episodes that are failing are
good examples of things to include. Don't forget to include the exact error
message if you are getting one, and a screenshot can also be useful.

Please only report one bug or make one enhancement request per issue, as
otherwise I'll ask you to re-submit them as separate issues. This is so that I
can keep a track of individual changes.
